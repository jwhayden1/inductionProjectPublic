# inductionProjectPublic
Debugging induction task 1 (Python). 
A very simple game has been constructed. However, there are some bug within the program that I would like you to find and fix. 
Some are obvious, others not so. In fact, you may find unintentional bugs! 
Instructions: 
1.	Use the software centre to download python. 
2.	Navigate to GitHub.
3.	Search InductionProjectPublic.
4.	You should find two python files.
5.	Download both. 

Expected behaviour and requirements. 
Watch the demo video. 
•	The program will prompt the user for a choice, which must be rock, paper or scissors and will be case insensitive. 
•	The program will check for valid input – must be string literals “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors” (case insensitive). If other input is provided, the program will re-prompt the user for a choice. 
•	The program will display the winner and loser each time.
•	The program will ask the user whether they wish to play again every time the game is played. The user should type “Y” for yes and “N” for no. These characters should be case insensitive. 




1.	Identify the bug(s):

2.	Implement a fix. 



3.	Can you tidy up the styling of the code at all? 



4.	Extend the functionality. How could you extend the current program?
